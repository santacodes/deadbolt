## üîç Overview

Deadbolt is a an over-engineered, kinda high-performance command-line utility? for generating Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) used in two-factor authentication. It leverages [SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_instruction,_multiple_data) instructions optimized through [xsimd](https://github.com/xtensor-stack/xsimd) instructions (AVX2, SSE4.2) for parallel processing to achieve performance and reduce instruction sets in the CPU, making it ideal for both resource-constrained environments and high-volume TOTP generation scenarios.

The application is designed with security as a primary concern, integrating seamlessly with the Linux Keyring Kernel Module [(Libsecret)](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Libsecret) for secure storage and retrieval of cryptographic keys. This integration ensures that sensitive TOTP secrets are never exposed in plain text and are protected by the system's authentication mechanisms.

## üíª System Requirements

Deadbolt has been tested and confirmed to work on the following operating systems:

deadbolt remove <service>

# Example:
deadbolt remove github

# Show details about a stored service
deadbolt info <service>

# Example:
deadbolt info github
```

## ‚ö° Performance

Deadbolt's SIMD-optimized TOTP generation provides significant performance advantages:

| Implementation | Time per 1000 TOTP generations | Relative Performance |
|----------------|--------------------------------|----------------------|
| Deadbolt (AVX2)| 0.18s                          | 5.33x                |
| Deadbolt (SSE4.2) | 0.24s                       | 4.00x                |
| Deadbolt (SSE2) | 0.36s                         | 2.67x                |
| Standard Impl. | 0.96s                          | 1.00x                |

Memory usage comparison:

| Implementation | Peak Memory Usage | Idle Memory Usage |
|----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Deadbolt       | 4.2 MB           | 1.8 MB            |
| Other TOTP Apps| 15-50 MB         | 8-20 MB           |

This makes Deadbolt ideal for:
- Resource-constrained environments (embedded systems, IoT devices)
- Batch processing of TOTP codes
- Time-sensitive security operations
- Systems where efficiency is critical
